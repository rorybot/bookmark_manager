I'm having an issue where I get the following error when running ruby /app/app.rb :

I've setup everything so it should only use json 1.8.6. I've uninstalled any other gem of json. I've tried deleting gemfile.lock and reinstalling. I've tried deleting Gemfile and re-requiring line-by-line. I've tried re-doing bundle in a bunch of different variations of requiring and not requiring versions or gemfiles, both before and after uninstalling or re-installing. Every time I still get this exact same error however.


I'm also having an issue where I tried to create "database_setup" file in models, and just require it into link.rb, but it throws up an error about how it doesn't know about method 'include?' But that's less important.
